            <h2>Tower Defense</h2>
            <p>
                In this project which I have called Tower Defense, we were ordered to make you guessed it a tower defense game.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see in the documentation, I only spent around 50% of the time programming, the other 50% was spent on making art for the game. This was due to me wanting to spend time experimenting with art implementation and art creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in terms of programming, it really is the minimum for the assignment. However, every single sprite and art piece (except the skeleton enemy) was created by me.
            </p>
            <p>
                When talking about some of the individual features, I'll explain the targeting of the towers using a visual sheet.
            </p>

                        <p>
                            Each tower sprite was carefully designed to represent different elemental themes and combat roles. I focused on creating distinct visual identities for each tower type while maintaining a cohesive art style throughout the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Desert Tower was inspired by the world of League of Legends, specifically the Shuriman desert. The Ice Tower was a design I have had in my head for a long time, and this assignment gave me the perfect opportunity to bring it to life. The Wizard Tower was an obvious choice - after all, what tower defense game would be complete without a wizard tower?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All sprites were hand-drawn using the drawing app Krita, focusing on creating unique visual identities while maintaining gameplay clarity.
