            <h2>Tower Defense</h2>
            <p>
                In this project which I have called Tower Defense, we were ordered to make ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî a tower defense game.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see in the documentation, I only spent around 50% of the time programming, the other 50% was spent on making art for the game. this was due to me wanting to spend time experimenting with art implementation and art creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in terms of programming, it really is the minimum for the assignment. However, every single sprite and art piece (except the skeleton enemy) was created by me.
            </p>
            <p>
                When talking about some of the individual features, I'll explain the targeting of the towers using a visual sheet.
            </p>

                            Each tower sprite was carefully designed to represent different elemental themes and combat roles. I focused on creating distinct visual identities for each tower type while maintaining a cohesive art style throughout the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Desert Tower was inspired by the world of League of Legends, specifically the Shuriman desert. The Ice Tower was a design I have had in my head for a long time, and this assignment gave me the perfect opportunity to bring it to life. The Wizard Tower was an obvious choice. after all, what tower defense game would be complete without a wizard tower?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All sprites were hand-drawn using the drawing app Krita.
